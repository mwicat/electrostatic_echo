## Conductive rubber head sources

Personally, I think that 1 mm thick rubber sheets are better to work with than
0.5 mm ones but in the end the goal is to stick them to normal rubber which will
provide
the base so that shouldn't matter too much. I am providing mostly links to
polish stores. You should be able to place international order, but the
easiest way is to actually look for local suppliers of conductive rubber
from Adafruit product number 5463, or from "Termpoasty" company.
